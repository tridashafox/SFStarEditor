Original creation by tridasha.

Windows GUI tool that lets you create a new star system with a planet in an existing Starfield ESP pluging file.
C++ visual studio 2022 project.

Limitations:
1. Creates a new star and planet by duplicating an existing star or planet with some changes (name and position)
2. Does not allow more than one planet to be added currently.
3. Only very limited changes to the star or planet
